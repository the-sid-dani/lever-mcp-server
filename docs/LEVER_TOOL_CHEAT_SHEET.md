# Lever MCP Tool - Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## 🚀 How to Use
Simply ask Claude in natural language, like talking to a colleague!

## ✅ GOOD Search Examples

### By Company
```
"Find people who worked at Mindshare, OMD, or GroupM"
"Show me candidates from WPP agencies in London"
```

### By Skills
```
"Find programmatic traders with DSP experience"
"Show me candidates with Google DV360 expertise"
```

### By Location
```
"Find digital marketing professionals in London or Manchester"
"Show me UK-based candidates with agency experience"
```

### Combined (Best Results)
```
"Find programmatic traders from GroupM or Publicis in London 
with DSP experience"
```

## ❌ AVOID These Searches
- "Show me all candidates" → Too broad
- "Find everyone in marketing" → Too vague
- "List all UK candidates" → Too large

## 🔧 If You Get Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No results found" | Try broader terms or check spelling |
| "Too many subrequests" | Search fewer companies at once |
| "Connection timeout" | Make search more specific |

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. **Start specific**: "programmatic traders" not "marketing people"
2. **Limit companies**: Search 5-10 companies at a time, not 20+
3. **Follow up**: "Tell me more about [candidate name]"
4. **Request limits**: "Show me the top 10 candidates"

## 📝 Search Formula
```
"Find [ROLE] with [SKILLS] from [COMPANIES] in [LOCATION]"
```

## ⚡ Quick Wins
- Search by email if you have it
- Ask for candidates by application stage
- Request specific details (skills, experience, location)
- Keep searches in same conversation for context

**Remember**: Less is more - specific searches get better results!
