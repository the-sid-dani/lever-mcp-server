# 🚀 Lever Search Tool - Quick Start for Recruiters

## What Is This?
A tool that lets you search your Lever candidate database using natural language through Claude Desktop. Just ask Claude like you would ask a colleague!

## 🎯 The Golden Rule
**Be specific but reasonable** - Not too broad, not too narrow!

## ✅ Perfect Search Examples

```
"Find programmatic traders from Mindshare or OMD in London"

"Show me account managers with WPP experience in the UK"

"Find candidates with Google DV360 skills from major agencies"
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ "Show me all candidates" - Too broad!  
❌ "Find everyone in marketing" - Too vague!  
❌ "List every UK person from every agency" - Too large!

## 📊 What You'll Get Back

- **Name & Email**: Contact details
- **Stage**: Where they are (lead-new, lead-responded, etc.)
- **Company History**: Where they've worked
- **Location**: Where they're based
- **Application Date**: When they entered your system
