# Lever ATS Use Cases

## Overview
High-value use cases for identifying top applicants in our ATS (Lever), especially when Lever's native search/filter tools are limited or slow.

## Core Use Case Categories

### 1. Skill-Based Ranking for Technical Roles
**Business Need:** You're hiring for a backend engineer or data analyst, and want to prioritize applicants with niche skills like Rust, PostgreSQL, or Kafka.

**Desired Outcome:**
- Find exact skill matches with context (e.g., "Led Kafka implementation" > "Exposed to Kafka")
- Rank candidates based on keyword strength, recency, and job relevance
- Surface the most qualified technical candidates quickly

### 2. Source Attribution + Performance Insights
**Business Need:** You want to evaluate inbound applicants from different job boards (e.g., LinkedIn vs. AngelList vs. company site) and identify which channel is delivering the highest-quality talent.

**Desired Outcome:**
- Correlate applicant sources with quality signals (e.g., FAANG experience, Series B startups, Ivy League schools, keywords like "scaled" or "architected")
- Get data-driven insights on applicant source quality
- Optimize recruiting channel investment

*Note: Lever tracks source but doesn't help you tie source to talent density or downstream conversion without extra work.*

### 3. Behavioral Signal Extraction for Top Performer Traits
**Business Need:** You're hiring for a high-impact role and want to identify self-starters or strategic thinkers based on how candidates describe their work (e.g., using verbs like "led," "designed," "shipped," or "scaled").

**Desired Outcome:**
- Score behavioral indicators from resume language
- Surface candidates that show patterns of ownership, impact, or cross-functional work
- Identify high-potential candidates based on qualitative signals

*Note: ATS filters often ignore the qualitative signal buried in resume phrasing, which can be a strong early predictor of candidate quality.*

## Specific Use Case Examples

### Company-Targeted Searches
**Use Case:** "Give me a list of new applicants for the Senior Software Engineer role who previously worked at Stripe, Shopify, or Snowflake."

### Location-Based Filtering
**Use Case:** "Pull all candidates in the New Applicant stage for the Field Marketing Manager role who are based in Austin, Denver, or NYC."

### Keyword + Industry Combination
**Use Case:** "For the Chief of Staff role, find resumes in the pipeline that mention 'OKRs,' 'Board decks,' or 'cross-functional alignment' and come from Investment Banking companies."

## Business Value
- **Speed:** Faster candidate identification and prioritization
- **Consistency:** Standardized evaluation criteria across all candidates
- **Discovery:** Uncover high-quality candidates that might be missed by basic searches
- **Data-Driven Hiring:** Quantitative insights for better recruiting decisions
