## Quick Reference: Common Workflows

### Finding a Specific Person
1. Use `lever_search_candidates` with email (most accurate)
2. If no email, use name search
3. For complex criteria, use `lever_advanced_search`

### Finding Candidates from Specific Companies
```
lever_advanced_search({
  companies: ["Google", "Meta"],
  current_company_only: true
})
```

### Reviewing Applicants for a Role in Specific Stages
```
lever_find_candidates_for_role({
  posting_id: "abc123",
  stage_names: ["Application Review", "Phone Screen"]
})
```

### Moving Candidates Through Pipeline
```
lever_update_candidate({
  opportunity_id: "xyz789",
  stage_name: "Technical Interview"
})
```

### Advanced Talent Search
```
lever_advanced_search({
  companies: ["Apple", "Google"],
  skills: ["Python", "AWS"],
  stages: ["Interview"],
  created_after: "2024-01-01",
  mode: "comprehensive"
})
```

## Important Limitations

1. **No Resume Content Search**: Cannot search within resume text
2. **No File Downloads**: Files must be accessed through Lever web interface  
3. **Search Limits**: Results limited based on tool and mode

- **Start with lever_advanced_search** - it covers most use cases
- **Use email search when possible** - it's faster and more accurate
